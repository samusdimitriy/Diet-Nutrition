<summary>Foreword</summary>
<p>Welcome to a ten-year journey of exploring nutrition for improved physical and mental performance. Nutrition is a complex topic, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Through research and personal experimentation, I have developed an evidence-based approach to optimize nutrition.</p>
<p>In this guide, I share the importance of nutrition for overall well-being. I focus on whole foods from various sources, including responsibly sourced proteins, nutrient-dense vegetables, fruits, nuts, mushrooms, and healthy fats. I don't count calories but instead fuel my body with nutritious foods to avoid overeating.</p>
<p>While whole foods may be slightly more expensive, investing in high-quality, sustainable options is crucial for maximizing performance and reaping the benefits of a wholesome diet.</p>
<p>This guide doesn't offer quick fixes or rigid diet plans. Instead, it encourages informed choices for long-term health and vitality. So, join me on this journey of nourishing your body with intention and purpose, and experience the positive impact it can have on your well-being.</p>

<summary>The Lifestyle</summary>
<p>a cultivation of my personal learnings and experience through a diverse animal-dominant, pasture-raised, grass-fed and finished eating philosophy.</p>
<h3>The Pursuit of Optimal Health</h3>
<p>In my pursuit of optimal health, I turned to the wisdom of our ancestors. An animal-dominant whole-food diet, rooted in the foods our forebears thrived on, holds what I believe are the keys to unlocking a vibrant and robust life. My biggest take aways have been the levels of sustained energy, mental clarity and optimal physical performance that comes from a clean, well-sourced diet.</p>
<p>For many, food has become synonymous with taste experiences, indulgence, and sometimes even guilt. In adopting the whole-food, ethically sourced, lifestyle, I encourage you to challenge this perspectiveâ€”to view food not merely as a source of taste sensations but as the primary fuel that sustains and energises your body.</p>
<p>Optimal health and well-being are intricately linked to the quality of the foods we consume. Quality matters - this is a holistic approach to well-being. I've crafted this to be a comprehensive guide, intended to be read cover to cover and then revisited for quick access to practical steps on weekly eating, grocery lists, and daily routines. By following the guidance in these pages, my aim is to challenge your current beliefs, offering education and guidance to foster a new, empowering relationship with how you treat and nourish your body.</p>

<summary>Recovery</summary>
<p>As an athlete, recovery is an essential component of your training regimen. It is during the recovery phase that your body repairs and rebuilds itself, allowing you to perform at your best and avoid injuries. Recovery is not just about resting; it involves a combination of strategies to promote healing, reduce muscle soreness, and enhance overall performance.</p>
<p>One of the key elements of recovery is adequate rest. This means getting enough sleep to allow your body to recharge and repair itself. Sleep is when your muscles and tissues undergo repair and growth, and it is also crucial for mental and emotional well-being. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night to support your recovery process.</p>
<p>In addition to sleep, nutrition plays a vital role in recovery. Consuming a balanced diet that includes a variety of nutrient-dense foods is essential for optimal recovery. Protein is particularly important for athletes, as it helps repair and rebuild muscle tissue. Carbohydrates replenish glycogen stores, which are depleted during exercise, while healthy fats provide energy and support hormone production. Hydration is also crucial, as it aids in nutrient delivery and waste removal.</p>
<p>Active recovery is another strategy that athletes can utilize to enhance their recovery process. This involves engaging in low-intensity activities such as stretching, yoga, or light cardio exercises. These activities promote blood flow to the muscles, helping to flush out metabolic waste and reduce muscle soreness. Active recovery also helps to maintain flexibility and prevent muscle imbalances.</p>
<p>Incorporating recovery techniques such as massage, foam rolling, and stretching can also be beneficial for athletes. These techniques help to release muscle tension, improve flexibility, and increase blood circulation. They can be particularly useful for targeting specific areas of soreness or tightness.</p>
<p>Lastly, mental and emotional recovery is just as important as physical recovery. High-intensity training and competition can take a toll on your mental well-being, so it's essential to prioritize activities that help you relax and destress. This may include practices such as meditation, mindfulness, or engaging in hobbies and activities that bring you joy.</p>
<p>As an athlete, understanding and implementing effective recovery strategies is crucial for maximizing your performance and preventing injuries. By prioritizing rest, nutrition, active recovery, and mental well-being, you can ensure that your body is in the best possible condition to excel in your chosen sport. Remember, recovery is not a luxury but a necessity for every athlete striving to reach their full potential.</p>
<p>In addition to the strategies mentioned earlier, sauna and ice bath are two popular recovery methods that many athletes incorporate into their routines.</p>
<details>
<summary>Sauna</summary>
<p>Sauna sessions can be beneficial for athletes as they promote relaxation, improve circulation, and aid in muscle recovery. Spending time in a sauna helps to increase blood flow to the muscles, which can help reduce muscle soreness and accelerate the removal of metabolic waste products. The heat from the sauna also helps to relax tight muscles and promote a sense of calm and well-being.</p>
<p> I recommend a sauna 2-3 times per week for 5-20 minutes each.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Cold Exposure</summary>
<p>Ice baths, on the other hand, involve immersing your body in cold water or using ice packs to reduce inflammation and promote recovery. The cold temperature helps to constrict blood vessels, which can reduce swelling and inflammation in the muscles. Ice baths are commonly used after intense workouts or competitions to help reduce muscle soreness and speed up the recovery process. It's important to note that ice baths should be used with caution and for a limited duration to avoid potential risks such as hypothermia or skin damage. </p>
<p>I recommend 11 minutes of Cold Exposure per week. You can split it into 2-4 sessions of 1-5 min each.</p>
</details>
<p>Both sauna and ice bath can be effective recovery tools, but it's essential to listen to your body and consult with a professional before incorporating them into your routine. Every athlete is unique, and what works for one person may not work for another. Experimenting with different recovery methods and finding what works best for you is key to optimizing your recovery as an athlete.</p>

<summary>Eating Principles</summary>
<p>Given the ongoing debate around nutrition, I have identified five eating principles that are widely accepted and believed to enhance physical and mental performance. By following these principles, I truly believe that you will be ahead of 99% of the population in terms of health, well-being, and longevity.</p>
<ol>
<li>Prioritize Whole, Unprocessed Foods: The first and most important step you can take is to minimize or eliminate processed foods from your diet. By choosing whole, unprocessed foods, you provide your body with essential nutrients like vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants.</li>
<li>Opt for Grass-fed, Pasture-Raised, and Wild-Caught Foods: While these foods may be more expensive, they offer higher nutritional value, are environmentally sustainable, and are ethically sourced. Consider every dollar spent on these foods as an investment in your health, leading to improved performance, mental clarity, and well-being.</li>
<li>Avoid Grains, Simple Carbohydrates, and Sugar: Foods like grains, simple carbohydrates, and sugar can cause spikes in blood sugar levels, leading to a lack of sustained energy throughout the day. They are also high in calories with minimal nutrient content and are known to contribute to inflammation and digestive issues.</li>
<li>Practice Time-Restricted Feeding: To reduce calorie intake and allow your body sufficient time to digest and process food, I recommend following a 16/8 plan at least 2-3 times per week. This involves consuming all your meals within an 8-hour window and fasting for the remaining 16 hours. Or a 24 hour fast 1-2 times per week. With a 24-hour fast, you eat your last meal at 6 pm, for example, and then don't eat your first meal until 6 pm the next day.</li>
<li>Embrace Mindful Eating: If you struggle with overeating, I suggest slowing down and paying attention to your hunger and fullness cues. Engage in mindful eating by avoiding distractions like watching TV or working while eating. This will help you better recognize when you're satisfied and prevent overconsumption.</li>
</ol>
<p>By incorporating these principles into your lifestyle, you can improve your overall health, well-being, and longevity.</p>

<summary>Supplements</summary>
<p>Supplements can be a helpful addition to one's diet, especially when it becomes challenging to obtain all the necessary nutrients through regular food intake. They can help address specific deficiencies or support specific health needs. However, it is always advisable to strive for a balanced diet and aim to cover as many nutrients as possible through natural sources. A diverse and balanced diet consisting of fresh foods usually provides all the essential nutrients that the body requires. Therefore, if possible, I recommend relying on nutrition as the primary source of nutrients and considering supplements as additional support.</p>
<p>My personal must haves:</p>
<details><summary>Omega 3 Fish-Oil</summary><p>It helps ensure you have your daily requirement of good fats which support your brain and overall well-being. I recommend 2-4 grams per day.</p></details>
<details><summary>Magnesium</summary><p>An essential mineral that supports muscle recovery, relaxation, and quality sleep. 200-400 mg per day works well for most people.</p></details>
<details><summary>Protein &amp; Collagen Powder</summary><p>A convenient way to increase daily protein intake and support joint health. Use in smoothies or shakes when needed.</p></details>
<details><summary>Vitamin D3/K2</summary><p>Helps with calcium absorption and overall immune function. Many people are deficient, so 2000-5000 IU daily is recommended.</p></details>
<details><summary>Creatine Monohydrate</summary><p>One of the most researched supplements for strength and muscle growth. Take 5 grams daily.</p></details>

<summary>Cheat Meals</summary>
<p>The question is: Should you have cheat meals?
My answer to that is: No.
In my opinion, you should eat in such a way that you don't have the urge to cheat on your diet.
I've tried so many things in my past and have come to the conclusion that the less you eat such foods, the less you crave them.
Of course, you can also get in shape with it.
In the past, I also ate pizza and ice cream every week and still had a great body.
However, this guide is not just about the physical appearance but also about your mental and physical health.
And constantly thinking about certain foods and having to think about calories is not a normal behavior.
Please try not eating processed foods and sugar for at least two to three weeks.
You'll find that after a while you won't crave it at all and if you eat it again after a long time, it won't taste as good as you remember.
Of course, there will always be times when we are confronted with certain decisions due to social events etc.
But then try to think consciously and choose wisely.</p>

<summary>Research and Preferences</summary>
<p>I want to clarify that I am not a medical professional or trained nutritionist. The information I am sharing is based on my own research, personal experience, and trial and error. Nutrition is a highly debated topic in the health, fitness, and well-being world, and there are various perspectives and opinions on what constitutes a healthy diet.</p>
<p>With that being said, I have gathered information from different sources to develop my own approach to nutrition. I believe in incorporating a diverse range of whole foods into my diet, with an emphasis on animal-based products, to enhance both cognitive and physical performance. However, I encourage you to explore these sources and seek out additional ones to form your own opinion and make informed decisions in your own kitchen. It's important to find what works best for you and aligns with your individual goals and beliefs.</p>
<p>I draw my knowledge mainly from the experts listed below
